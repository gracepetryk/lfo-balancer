lfo-balancer
============
LFO Balancer is a small addon for KSP that dumps just enough oxidizer to burn all the remaining liquid fuel with conventional rockets as the jet engines are being used on a spaceplane.

## Usage
1. Click the applauncher button to enable the balancer. It will reset every time a vessel is loaded so fuel will never be dumped on accident. 
2. The balancer includes locked resources in it's calculations, but it will not dump them. This is useful for reserving fuel for multiple takeoffs / landings.
3. If Advanced Tweakables are enabled, each tank will have the option to disable the balancer completley and the balancer will pretend as if the balanced tank isn't there.
